First, an event must occur, like user login, process launch, or file download. Then, the system, like your OS, a firewall, or a cloud provider must log the event. After that, all system logs must be shipped to a security solution like SIEM or EDR. The SOC team can receive millions of logs per day from thousands of different systems, where most of the events are expected, but some require attention. Alert, a notification generated by a security solution when a specific event or sequence of events occurs, is what saves SOC analysts from manual log review by highlighting only suspicious, anomalous events. With alerts, analysts triage just dozens of alerts per day instead of millions of raw logs.

L1 Role in Alert Triage

SOC L1 analysts are the first line of defence, and they are the ones who work with alerts the most. Depending on various factors, L1 analysts may receive zero to a hundred alerts a day, every one of which can reveal a cyberattack. Still, everyone in the SOC team is somehow involved in the alert triage:

SOC L1 analysts:  Review the alerts, distinguish bad from good, and notify L2 analysts in case of a real threat
SOC L2 analysts:  Receive the alerts escalated by L1 analysts and perform deeper analysis and remediation
SOC engineers:  Ensure the alerts contain enough information required for efficient alert triage
SOC manager:  Track speed and quality of alert triage to ensure that real attacks won't be missed
