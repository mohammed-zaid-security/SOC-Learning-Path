 What's next? Recall the second task, where you see hundreds of alerts but have to choose which to pick up first. The process of deciding which to take is called Alert Prioritisation, and it is crucial to ensure timely detection of a threat, especially with many alerts in the queue.

Picking the Right Alert

Every SOC team decides on its own prioritisation rules and usually automates them by setting the appropriate alert sorting logic in SIEM or EDR. Below, you may see the generic, simplest, and most commonly used approach:
Filter the alerts
Make sure you don't take the alert that other analysts have already reviewed, or that is already being investigated by one of your teammates. You should only take new, yet unseen and unresolved alerts.

Sort by severity
Start with critical alerts, then high, medium, and finally low. This is because detection engineers design rules so that critical alerts are much more likely to be real, major threats and cause much more impact than medium or low ones.

Sort by time
Start with the oldest alerts and end with the newest ones. The idea is that if both alerts are about two breaches, the hacker from the older breach is likely already dumping your data, while the "newcomer" has just started the discovery.
