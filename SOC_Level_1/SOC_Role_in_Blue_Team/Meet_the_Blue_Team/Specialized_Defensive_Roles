Large companies, technology-focused startups, and government agencies often require narrow and specialized Blue Team roles - exciting and highly valuable, but requiring deep topic knowledge and broad experience in broader fields like SOC or IT. These narrow roles can include:


Digital Forensics Analyst: Uncover hidden threats in disk and memory
Threat Intelligence Analyst: Gather data about emerging threat groups
AppSec Engineer: Maintain a secure software development lifecycle
AI Researcher: Study AI threats and how to defend against them
