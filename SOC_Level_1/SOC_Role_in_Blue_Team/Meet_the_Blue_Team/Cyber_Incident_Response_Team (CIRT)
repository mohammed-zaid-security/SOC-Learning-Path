If SOC expertise is not enough or the incident goes out of control, you urgently call the "firefighters" - CIRT, also called CSIRT or CERT. The members should have a broad knowledge of cyber threats and handle breaches without depending on tools like EDR or SIEM. A CIRT job is stressful and responsible, but also rewarding. Here are a few CIRT examples:


JPCERT: Japan's CERT handling nation-wide breaches
Mandiant: A private team responding to global cyber incidents
AWS CIRT: Investigates security incidents of AWS customers
