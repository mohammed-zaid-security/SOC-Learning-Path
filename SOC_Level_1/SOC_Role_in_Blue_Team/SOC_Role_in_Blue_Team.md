In tiny companies, the IT department takes the role of securing the company. Small to medium-sized companies may have a generic "Information Security" team that does all sorts of tasks. For this room, we will focus on bigger companies with a CISO overseeing multiple security teams, each handling a specific task. For example:

Red Team: Offensive security experts, pentesters, or ethical hackers who look for security issues
GRC Team: Specialists managing policies and ensuring compliance with regulations like PCI DSS
Blue Team: Defensive security experts like SOC analysts, engineers, or incident responders
