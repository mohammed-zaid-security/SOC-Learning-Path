First, L1 analysts receive the alerts in a SIEM, EDR, or a ticket management platform. Most of the alerts are closed as False Positives or are handled on L1 level, but complex and threatening ones are sent to L2 that remediate most breaches. And to send the alerts further, you need to learn three new terms: reporting, escalation, and communication.

Alert Reporting
Before closing or passing the alert to L2, you might have to report it. Depending on team standards and alert severity, instead of a short alert comment, you can be required to document your investigation in detail, ensuring all relevant evidence is included. This is especially important for True Positives, which require escalation.

Alert Escalation
If the True Positive alert requires additional actions or deeper investigation, escalate it to the L2 analyst for further review following the agreed procedures. That's where your alert report comes in handy since L2 will use it to get the initial context and spend less on the analysis from scratch.

Communication
You may also need to communicate with other departments during or after the analysis. For example, ask the IT team if they confirm granting administrative privileges to some users or contact HR to get more information about the newly hired employee.
