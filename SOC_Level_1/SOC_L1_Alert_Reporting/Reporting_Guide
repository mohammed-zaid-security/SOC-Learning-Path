Report Format

Imagine yourself as an L2 analyst, a DFIR team member, or an IT professional who needs to understand the alert. What would you want to see in the report? We recommend you follow the Five Ws approach and include at least these items in the report:

Who: Which user logs in, runs the command, or downloads the file
What: What exact action or event sequence was performed
When: When exactly did the suspicious activity start and ended
Where: Which device, IP, or website was involved in the alert
Why: The most important W, the reasoning for your final verdict
